-- if you've made some steps, what were they?
no steps made so far

-- if there's technical things you puzzling over, what are they?
The QT/Hex stuff, maybe?

-- if you have some hopes for stages through which the thing might go,
what are they?
*keep a score between games
*increased no. of blanks as increased hardness
(this can work as the player will have been working with the
same dictionary of words each time, so it won't be too impossible?)
*could give the user a word in english and a the, for example,
french translation of the word with a no. of blanks that you have to
guess so it's like a new-french-word-learning game using word gaps
*or, given a verb with last few letters blank & 'present conditional'
*adding a GUI using the Qt classes
*could have it so using QT they click a button for which type of
game they want to play, e.g. translations or verb inflections
probably use two different dictionaries, one for verbs, one for not-verbs
and hence two different vector<string> variables. Which vector depends
on which button pressed?
